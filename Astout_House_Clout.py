Hello, universe! I am BACK WITH yet another self project.

I just recently completed my first project, a baseball analytics project where I grouped every past team with their current franchise, 
completed a bunch of merging, garnered up a bunch of baseball statistics, pulled together all of the greatest players per franchise,
and had them fight head to head in two different tournament styles in order to see which team is the greatest of all time.

The project took nearly 50 hours, and I averaged about 2 hours every coding day. Lots of positives and lots of negatives:


Positives:

- Improved strategy and plannning skills

While this wasn't the most difficult project in the world, there was a TON of moving parts and
I had a lot of issues come up that I had to fix. There were lots of ideas I had, and I wasn't super sure on how to go about it,
and, with the help of considerable amount of aid from ChatGPT, I was able to complete my main objective, creating the tournament
with my own specifications on how stats would be rewarded. 

- Had a TON of fun with the project

- Learned some, but gained a ton of insight on the things that I need to do to improve



Negatives:

- Easily too reliant on ChatGPT

I did use it to learn a lot about how my code worked, but I used it way more to generate the code
I needed to get past particular bugs and not give it too much of a second thought. I did not give
myself many opportunities to figure out the problem before GPT and increase my own problem solving skills.

- Lazy with the organization and comments

- Was not consistent and dilligent about completing the project

I should have spent longer on days that I did work on it, and I should have spent more days than not on
the project. I made a lot of excuses to get out of working on my project.




Lots of takeaways from the project. All in all, I learned, and I'm happy with how it turned out! My second project will be more refined,
more dilligently worked on, and I will learn a lot more than I did on the first one.












Main objective: I became a real estate agent overnight! I have been supplied with a few different datasets and I've been tasked to make
a presentation selling several different kinds of houses based on the specifications potential customers want. I'll show graphs, charts, 
and actual pictures of houses in my visual representation, and I will refine the project in either PowerBI, Tableau, or some other
visualization software.

Main objective 2: Show it to a crowd! At a minimum, show one or more of the roommates the completed presentation and see what they think! 
Afterwards, show the code and be able to explain things further if needed.



Presentation MUST include:

- A brief, technical explanation on why and how I decided to code my project the way that I did. This explanation needs to be directed
towards my fellow real estate agent coworkers, as I am showing them the ropes as to how to find the optimal houses for potential buyers.
It should be worded in a way that beginner coders should be able to understand, with elaboration on the parts that may seem more difficult.

- A brief, non-techhnial explanation on what I had to do for my project and why it should be beneficial for the buyers. This explanation
needs to be interesting enough to keep the buyers intrigued, and it should use some images/graphs in tandem to help the presentation stick
out a bit more.

- Lots of house images and blueprints! The customers need to see what they might be buying!

- Graphs and charts, but they will look very refined and serve important purposes. I will not overuse them in this presentation.


Presentation SHOULD include:

- TBD

Presentation COULD include:

- TBD


Side objectives:

- Use Github! Also put your first project on github.

- Use separate code files and run the real deal on one giant shell file

- Use several different datasets from different sources and concatenate, I want to look at tons of data
    - After concatenation, I want to figure out the best ways to impute missing values (averages could be a replacement, 
    for example)

- Include at least two more packages, do research on them beforehand



















Updates per day I worked on it:

7/14/2024: Initialized project (Does not count for a day of working on it)

7/15/2024: Outlined my main objectives and side objectives for the project, educated myself on GitHub
and its possibilities, installed GitHub stuff and practiced making different commits, formatted my
VSCode interface better and put everything into its own folder, started reading in files, ran into an
issue with a file size being too big and needing to take a few extra steps to get rid of it,
explored rebasing and conflicting merges, but was unable to fix the problem today
(5.25 hours)

7/16/2024: Got rid of duplicate variables, spent time learning about important options and when/when not
to use them (specifically subset, indexing [], how NOT to EVER use inplace = True), learned extensively about
the basics of numpy, how arrays work, and why I would use arrays over lists and series, and very slowly
went over how exactly I could perform linear regression using numpy, going over everything line by line so
that I knew how every part worked
(5.25 hours)

7/17/2024: Created more complex variables such as Confirmed_Extra_Features and began computing House_Score,
which will be my way of determining what I think are the best deals on houses based on how many total features it
has, what the price per square foot for living space and lot space are, and basement status. Theorized a great way
to give some of the more expensive houses some of the features that would normally come in nice houses, but they would
only get these features based on chance. I also showed Liam my current work on this project and last project, and he
gave me lots of ways to make my code more efficient, such as making more functions and doing nested merges.
(5.25 hours)

7/18/2024: Brushed up on my Pandas skills from youtube and FINALLY learned what inplace = True actually means, practiced
finding exact output using methods such as loc, different styles of indexing, and adding lists together with Stratascrach 
analytics practice questions. Attempted to make my function to assign random features from scratch, came up with a better result than
I thought but it needs a lot of editing. Theorized further steps as to where I would take the project at the very end.
Today was a much slower work day with less progress on the project, but there was a lot of learning and trying to figure out 
how to write certain steps without initial aid.
(5 hours)

7/19/2024:

Total Days worked on Project: 4

Total Number of Hours Worked on Project: 20.75 hours
